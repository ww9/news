### ðŸ“° News
News is a minimalist RSS/Atom aggregator that saves to HTML files.
```
ðŸ“‚news
  â”œðŸ“° index.html
  â”œðŸ“° page2.html
  â””ðŸ“° page3.html
```

That's it! No database, no configuration files, no HTTP server, no ads, no tracking and no JavaScript. Everything is stored in the HTML files which look like this:

### Usage

Running `news` creates `ðŸ“‚news` directory containing a sample `ðŸ“°index.html` file which you should edit with your own RSS/Atom feed sources.

Every 10 minutes it fetches news from your feeds and saves what's fresh to `ðŸ“°index.html`.

When `ðŸ“°index.html` grows large (1000 items by default), the oldest 500 items are moved to `ðŸ“°page2.html`.

`ðŸ“‚news` can reside in Google Drive or Dropbox for easy access everywhere. This is how I use it:

```
